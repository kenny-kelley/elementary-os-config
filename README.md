# Configuration files for a fresh install of elementary OS

There are notes of the packages I want install/remove via `apt`. Rather than write a script to do them all in one go, I prefer to verify each one of them.

Other files might be settings tweaks or scripts.

As of writing, this was for elementary OS 5.1.7 (Hera), which is built on top of Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS.

I definitely stole `50-mtrack.conf` from somewhere. It needs to be placed in `/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/`.
